## HTML & CSS practice: Hooli-style Popup

This practice has shown me that I need to be more careful when checking my code before creating PR and asking students in the chat room. I used the css-grid property for the grid in the popup and was surprised by the limitations of this method.

## JS Basics

Introduction to Javascript does a good job of showing the basic concepts of the language. During the FreeCodeCamp modules, I saw a lot of good assignments for practical problem-solving. It was interesting, I will come back to FreeCodeCamp when I am looking for solutions to new tasks.
